# Arty

Creative workspace for OBINexus sketches, prototypes, and flashes of design.

## Purpose
- A staging ground for **draft prototypes** (visuals, wireframes, conceptual notes).
- A place to capture **eurêka moments** quickly, without polishing.
- Serves as the **design front-end** feeding into other OBINexus repos.

## Structure
- `src/` → editable source files (vectors, design docs, notes).
- `dist/` → exports (images, pdfs).
- `avatars/` and `attire/` → curated visual collections.
- `sperion/` and `zettelion/` → experiments and zettelkasten-style notes.

## Workflow
1. Create quickly here (don’t overthink).
2. Export drafts to `dist/`.
3. Promote stable designs into their own repo/project when ready.
